A car owner's listing mobile application

## Getting Started

The Provider pattern was used as a design architecture for this application. To improve UI speed the concept of pagination was added to the listview to avoid loading all the data from file at once.

Dependencies used:

- [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http)
- [Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider)
- [csv](https://pub.dev/packages/csv)
- [flutter_launcher_icon](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_launcher_icons)
